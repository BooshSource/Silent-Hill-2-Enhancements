# Silent Hill 2 Enhancement
### Introduction
A project designed to enhance Silent Hill 2 (SH2) graphics and audio for the PC. It also includes scripts to build or modify SH2 audio files (SFX, BGM and Dialog).

### Features
Below is a list of features:

 * The [Widescreen Fix](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/WidescreenFixesPack/releases/tag/sh2) runs the game in widescreen to fit any sized monitor appropriately and fixes other inherit game bugs.
 * The [Nemesis2000 Fog Fix](http://ps2wide.net/pc.html#sh2) which makes the game's fog closer resemble the PlayStation 2's version which is considered the best
 * Dynamically updates SH2 memory with correct index locations for the SFX from the `sddata.bin` file (required if you are using a modified version of the `sddata.bin` file)
 * ASI loader to load custom libraries with the file extension .asi into the game using [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader)
 * Conversion of Direct3D 8 (d3d8.dll) to Direct3D 9 (d3d9.dll) using [d3d8to9](https://github.com/crosire/d3d8to9)
 * Disables the CD check
 * Resets the display adapter on exit to fix issue when using WineD3D casing the screen to go dark
 * Includes [scripts](AudioScripts) to allow you to create or update the SH2 audio files
