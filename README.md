# Silent Hill 2 Enhancement
### Introduction
A project designed to enhance Silent Hill 2 (SH2) graphics and audio for the PC. It also includes scripts to build or modify SH2 audio files (SFX, BGM and Dialog).

### Features
Below is a list of features:

 * [Widescreen Fix](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/WidescreenFixesPack/releases/tag/sh2) - to allow the game to fit any sized monitor appropriately and fixes other inherit game bugs.
 * [Nemesis2000 Fog Fix](http://ps2wide.net/pc.html#sh2) - which makes the game's fog closer resemble the PlayStation 2's version which is considered the best.
 * **PS2 Style Noise Filter** - to make the noise filter resemble the PlayStation 2's noise filter.
 * **SFX Address Fix** - to dynamically update SH2 memory with correct index locations for the SFX from the `sddata.bin` file (required if you are using a modified version of the `sddata.bin` audio file).
 * **ASI Loader** - to load custom libraries with the file extension .asi into the game using [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader).
 * **WndMode** - to run the game in windowed mode.
 * [d3d8to9](https://github.com/crosire/d3d8to9) - to convert Direct3D 8 (d3d8.dll) to Direct3D 9 (d3d9.dll).
 * **NoCD Patch** - to disable the CD check.
 * **Reset Screen Res** - to resets the display adapter on exit which fixes an issue when using WineD3D casing the screen to go dark.
 * [Audio Script Builder](AudioScripts) - to allow you to create or update the SH2 audio files.
